This guide outlines common account lockout scenarios and highlights the processes for confirming ownership, regaining access to an account, and updating the credentials of an account. Mapbox serves as critical infrastructure for our customers and we work hard to protect the security of your accounts, data, and end users.

If you’re still experiencing difficulties after working through this guide, [contact support](https://support.mapbox.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000279191).

If you have more general questions about your Mapbox account, see our [Account documentation](https://docs.mapbox.com/accounts/overview/).

## Account lockout scenarios

Maintaining access to an account starts by setting up your account with the recommendations listed in our [best practices guide for collaboration](/help/troubleshooting/collaboration-best-practices/). That said, here are some of the most common account lockout scenarios, how to fix them, and how to avoid them in the future.

### I don’t know the username or password for our Mapbox account

If you've inherited a project that uses Mapbox location services, but you don't have access to the login credentials, the information below will help you work with support team to confirm ownership of the account.

- **How to regain access:**
Please verify ownership of your account by [contacting support](https://support.mapbox.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000279191). In your request, include as many of these details as possible:

   - Full URL of an API request
   - Link to a live map
   - Invoice number
   - Mapbox username
   - Registered email address

- **Prevention:**
Save the username & password for your Mapbox account in a shared vault like a [1Password](https://1password.com/) vault and/or [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) and use an email address that is accessible for all your stakeholders.

### My colleague left the company with their email address still registered on our account

- **How to regain access:**
If a former colleague's email address is tied to your company's Mapbox account, try contacting your IT department requesting the email address be reactivated or forwarded automatically to an email of your choosing. Once you have access to that email address or forwarding rules are in place, you can [reset your password](https://account.mapbox.com/recover-password) to regain access to that account. Once you’ve regained access to your account, you can [change the email](https://docs.mapbox.com/accounts/overview/settings/#profile) to any of your choosing.

If you need our Security team to change the registered email on your account, we’ll need to [verify that you are the owner of the account](#help-i-dont-know-the-username-or-password-for-our-mapbox-account) first. [Send us a note](https://support.mapbox.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000279191) and we will be happy to look into it for you. We try and respond to all account verification and lockout troubleshooting requests within 1-2 business days of submission.

- **Prevention:**
Once you have access to your account, change the email to one that [multiple people have access to](/help/troubleshooting/collaboration-best-practices/#developers-designers-and-consultants) and store your credentials in a shared-secure location, like a [1Password](https://1password.com/) vault and/or [Okta](https://www.okta.com/). This will help keep your password safe and available when you or your teammates need it. Make sure the stakeholders (anyone who might need to access your account) know where to find the credentials.

### I’m not receiving the password reset email

<!--copyeditor ignore found -->

Have you tried sending yourself the [password reset instructions](https://docs.mapbox.com/accounts/overview/settings/#password) and still aren’t receiving the email? Emails can be temporarily undeliverable for various reasons. Sometimes the receiving email server cannot be found, gets overloaded, or becomes unavailable.

First, check that the emails haven’t landed in your Spam folder, then [contact support](https://support.mapbox.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000279191) to let us know you’re having trouble.  We can help.

### I lost my two-factor authentication (2FA) backup codes

[2FA](https://docs.mapbox.com/accounts/overview/settings/#security) provides an additional layer of security on your account. When enabled, logging in requires entering the password and a string of numbers generated by an authentication app like Google Authenticator—it’s free for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2). Backup codes are vital to regain access to your account. If you do not have the 2FA backup codes though, we might be able to help.

- **How to regain access:**
If you do not have your 2FA backup codes, we’ll need to verify that you’re the owner of the account, which [requires having a payment method](https://docs.mapbox.com/accounts/overview/settings/#security) on file. Please [contact support](https://support.mapbox.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000279191) to begin the verification process. If your account doesn’t have a payment method on file and we’re unable to verify ownership, consider creating a new account.

- **Prevention:** When you enable 2FA, a single-use recovery code is generated. **Write down this code and keep it in a safe place**, like a password manager:

You can find your recovery codes when you enable 2FA. This code can be found above the purple `Enable two-factor authentication` button.
